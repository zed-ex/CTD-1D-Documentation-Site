### Background
Originally conceived in March 2014 by game developer Gabriele Cirulli, the 2048 game emerged as a personal project. Drawing inspiration from the mechanics of Threes, this web-based, open-source game challenged players to merge numbered tiles through grid-based manoeuvres, with the ultimate goal of attaining the coveted 2048 tile. Its engaging gameplay and strategic elements propelled 2048 to rapid popularity.

### Scenario and Target User

In today's fast-paced lifestyles, users yearn for accessible activities that blend entertainment with cognitive exercise, making 2048 an ideal choice.

### Purpose and Benefits
Positioned as a tool for brain exercise, 2048 is designed to enhance strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities. Users engaging with the game undergo a mental exercise, refining decision-making skills, pattern recognition, and logical thinking. The software provides a platform for users to strategize, plan ahead, and adapt tactics, fostering cognitive development.

### How to Use / Gameplay
Navigate the game by sliding numbered tiles across a grid. Merge identical tiles to create a new tile with a sum value, striving to reach the elusive 2048 tile through strategic manoeuvres.
