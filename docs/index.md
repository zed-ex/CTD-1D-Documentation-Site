## Description
### Background
The 2048 game originated as a solo project by game developer Gabriele Cirulli in March 2014. It was initially inspired by the mechanics of the game Threes and was created as an open-source web-based game. The objective was to merge numbered tiles by sliding them across a grid, aiming to reach the elusive 2048 tile. Due to its addictive nature and strategic gameplay, 2048 quickly gained widespread popularity and recognition.

### Scenario and Target User
The software is designed for individuals seeking mental stimulation and challenges that test strategic thinking and logical reasoning. The typical characteristics of users interested in 2048 include puzzle enthusiasts, gamers looking for cerebral challenges, students aiming to enhance their cognitive skills, and professionals seeking a break to engage in a mentally stimulating activity. The interesting problem faced by users is the need for accessible activities that provide both entertainment and cognitive exercise in today's fast-paced lifestyles. Users often seek engaging yet mentally rewarding pastimes that fit within their busy schedules.

### Purpose and Benefits
2048 serves as a means to exercise the brain, enhance strategic thinking, and improve problem-solving abilities. By engaging with the game, users benefit from honing their decision-making skills, pattern recognition, and logical thinking. The software offers a mental workout that challenges users to strategize, plan ahead, and adapt tactics to overcome challenges.

### How to Use / Gameplay
The gameplay involves sliding numbered tiles across a grid. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one, creating a new tile with a value that is the sum of the two merged tiles. The objective is to reach the tile with the value of 2048 by merging tiles strategically. Players aim to maximize their score by employing thoughtful moves and avoiding gridlock.
