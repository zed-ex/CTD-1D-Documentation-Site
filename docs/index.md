### Background
This 2048 game aims to help children learn and memorize multiplication tables effectively. Inspired by the idea of gamifying educational content, this program aims to make learning math engaging, interactive, and enjoyable for young learners.

### Scenario and Target User
The software is designed for elementary school children (typically aged 6-12) who are in the process of learning multiplication tables. These children often face challenges in memorizing multiplication facts, finding the process tedious and uninspiring. The interesting problem addressed by this software is the struggle many children encounter in mastering multiplication tables due to traditional rote learning methods. The software provides an alternative, engaging method for them to practice and reinforce their multiplication skills.

### Purpose and Benefits

By gamifying the process, it aims to alleviate the boredom often associated with traditional memorization techniques. The program engages children through gameplay, fostering a deeper understanding of multiplication concepts while improving their recall abilities and mathematical fluency. By using this program, children can gain a stronger foundation in math, boosting their confidence and enthusiasm for learning.

### How to Use / Gameplay
The gameplay of "Multiplication Master: 2048 Edition" revolves around merging tiles containing multiplication problems. For instance, merging a tile with '3x3' and '6x6' yields '9x9'. The objective is to merge tiles and reach the highest multiplication number possible, which aligns with the original 2048 game concept. To progress, players solve multiplication problems as they slide and combine tiles strategically. The game reinforces multiplication facts in a dynamic and enjoyable manner.
